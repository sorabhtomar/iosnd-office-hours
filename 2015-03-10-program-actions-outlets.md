# OH: General Questions, Actions, and Outlets

Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending office hours earlier today (Tuesday, March 10) about the
Nanodegree program in general, actions, and outlets.

If you missed it, you can get to it by navigating [here][hangout].

Here's what Miriam, Eden, Chrisna, and Gabrielle covered:

## The Nanodegree program

If you haven't seen your [Nanodegree portal][portal] yet, you should take a
look!

We took some questions:

> Should we join Apple's iOS Developer Program? Does Udacity belong to Apple's
> iOS Developer University Program?

It's probably a good idea because joining the program will give you the ability
to have your creations on the App Store and test them on your devices but it is
not required to finish the Nanodegree program. We don't belong to the iOS
university program.

> Is there a printable list of lessons, courses, etc. that we should watch and
> an approximate timeline? That would be very helpful.

We'll get one up to the site hopefully by the end of the week!

> Can someone with no tech job experience and no degree/certificate in anything
> tech/coding related have a decent shot at being hired as an iOS Developer
> after taking this Nanodegree? I have some HTML skills but no other
> programming languages whatsoever.

Yes, we think so. If you put the time in and are serious about it, you will
have multiple, demonstrable examples of your newfound skills.

> Is it possible to add real (not YouTube-generated) subtitles to the videos?

We are in the process of putting them up for the orientation videos. They
should be there soon.

> This isn't really code related, but how long after we submit projects do we
> get them back? I've been waiting almost a week yet I've seen coaches on chat
> say it's usually within 24 hrs?

The number of submissions for the first project was a little surprising to us,
so we're catching up on our backlog. If you've been waiting almost a week, you
should receive an evaluation very shortly.

> I might know the concepts and the hierarchy of the app sequence in my mind
> but don't know how to write down the syntax! Is there any common approach to
> proceed with?

Practice helps a lot. This is something that everyone has trouble with at the
beginning, but, as we gain experience, we become more comfortable. Also note
that knowing every single detail about syntax is not something that
professional developers do. Instead, developers are very good at parsing
through documentation to piece together their logic in code.

> In lesson to of Intro to iOS Development, when we were asked to add the Stop
> Record button, I set the Image Set to use vector images. The instructor did
> it differently. Do I need to change my implementation before submitting my
> project?

Nope! As long as the project meets all of the specifications in the rubric,
your solution does not have to match the instructor's solution exactly.

> Are the TDD or BDD development approaches used in the Nanodegree?

Neither approach is discussed very much in the Nanodegree but we hope to add
resources about testing and debugging in the near future.
